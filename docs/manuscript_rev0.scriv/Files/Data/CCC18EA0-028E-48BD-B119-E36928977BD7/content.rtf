\f0\fs26 \cf0 For the first fine-tuning round, the positive dataset containing epitope-specific TCR CDR3beta sequences was compiled from three data sources on May 2021: Dash et al[\{Dash:2017go\}] containing \cf2 epitope-specific paired TCR\uc0\u945  and TCR\u946  c\cf0 hains for  three epitopes from humans and for seven epitopes from mice, two manually curated databases that contains pathology-associated TCR sequences, such as VDJdb[\{Bagaev:2019hf\}]({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://vdjdb.cdr3.net"}}{\fldrslt https://vdjdb.cdr3.net}}) and McPAS-TCR[\{Tickotsky:2017bo\}]({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://friedmanlab.weizmann.ac.il/McPAS-TCR/"}}{\fldrslt http://friedmanlab.weizmann.ac.il/McPAS-TCR/}}).  Every entry in VDJdb has been given a confidence score between 0  and 3 (0: critical information missing, 1: medium confidence, 2: high confidence, 3: very high  confidence). We selected all VDJdb entries \cf2 with a confidence score at least 1.  For the second fine-tuning round, COVID-19 epitope-specific CDR3beta sequence data was collected from Immune Epitope Database[\{Vita:2015\}]({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://iedb.org"}}{\fldrslt https://iedb.org}}) on June 2021.\
After selecting all epitopes that have at least 20 CDR3beta sequences and removing duplicates with the same \{epitope, CDR3beta\} from each fine-tuning dataset, two datasets contained 12,619 positive data points covering 80 epitopes and 49,273 positive data points covering 145 epitopes, respectively.\
