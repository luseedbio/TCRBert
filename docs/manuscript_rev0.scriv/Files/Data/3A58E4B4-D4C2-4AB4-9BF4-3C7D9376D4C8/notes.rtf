IEDB entries with non-class I, non-specific, mutant, or unparseable allele names were dropped, as were those with peptides identified by MS or containing post-translational modifications or noncanonical amino acids. This yielded an IEDB dataset of 143,898 quantitative and 43,978 qualitative affinity measurements. Of 179,692 measurements in the BD2013 dataset (\cf3 Kim et al., 2014\cf2 ), 57,506 were not also present in the IEDB dataset. After selecting peptides of length 8-15 and dropping alleles with fewer than 25 measurements, the combined dataset consists of 230,735 measurements across 130 alleles. }
