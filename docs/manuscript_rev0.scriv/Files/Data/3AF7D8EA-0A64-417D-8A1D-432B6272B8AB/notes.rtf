The MS model selection dataset consists of 226,684 ligands formed by combining 186,415 ligands from IEDB with 39,741 additional ligands from SysteMHC Atlas (\cf3 Shao et al., 2018\cf2 ) and 530 additional ligands from ref. (\cf3 Abelin et al., 2017\cf2 ). The unprocessed SysteMHC and Abelin et al. datasets are much larger but most entries are already present in IEDB, are duplicates, or report on alleles for which training was not attempted. The ligands from SysteMHC Atlas were first filtered to remove entries with low confidence (prob < 0.99). Of the 112 alleles supported by the predictor, 57 had at least 100 MS ligands available for model selection (\cf3 Table S1\cf2 ). \
