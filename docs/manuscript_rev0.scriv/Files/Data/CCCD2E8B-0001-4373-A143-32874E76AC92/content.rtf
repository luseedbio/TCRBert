\f0\fs26 \cf0 Here, we present a BERT-based model employing self-supervised transfer learning for predicting epitope-specific TCR recognition. The predictive model was generated by fine-tuning the pretrained TAPE model using epitope-specific TCR CDR3\'a5\'e2sequence datasets. We report that the fine-tuned model can achieve better performance in predicting the TCR recognition of COVID-19 epitopes. \
We anticipate our works to provide new directions for constructing a reliable model for predicting the immunogenic T-cell epitopes with limited training data and to be valuable for accelerating effective vaccine developments.\
