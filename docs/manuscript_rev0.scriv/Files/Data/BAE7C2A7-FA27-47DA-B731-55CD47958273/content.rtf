\f0\fs26 \cf0 For evaluating our model, the model was tested using two independent datasets: the dataset contained COVID-19 S-protein269-277(YLQPRTFLL)  with the 352 epitope-specific TCR\uc0\u946 s from the recent study of Shomuradova et al. [34](from hereon referred to as Shomuradova dataset) and the dataset contained 415 COVID-19 S-protein269-277-specific TCRs from the ImmuneRACE study launched by Adaptive Biotechnologies and Microsoft (https://immunerace.adaptivebiotech.com, June 10, 2020 dataset, 
\f1 from hereon referred to as ImmuneCODE dataset
\f0 )(Table S2).}
