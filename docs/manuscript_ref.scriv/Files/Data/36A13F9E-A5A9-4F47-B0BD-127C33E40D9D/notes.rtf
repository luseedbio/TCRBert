These data sets were obtained from Bassani-Sternberg et al. (22) and include ELs obtained from six cell lines, each with typed HLA expression. From these data, we constructed six benchmark data sets by enriching each positive EL data set with a set of random natural negative peptides (for details see Materials and Meth- ods). After filtering out data included in the training data of NetMHCpan-4.0, we next benchmarked the predictive power of the different prediction methods. The result of the benchmark is shown in Fig. 9. \
