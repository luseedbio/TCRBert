# TCRPE
### Predicting Epitope-specific TCR recognition using Pre-trained Protein Embeddings. 
The pre-trained embeddings were derived from 
the Tasks Assessing Protein Embeddings(TAPE) which is a semi-supervised BERT language model including the protein-specific prior knowledges, 
such as pairwise sequence similarity and contact information within residues.
